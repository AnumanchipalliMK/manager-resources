# How does Danielle even

Welcome to my README! I've heard that my passion can be a bit intimidating if you don't know me, so I wrote this README in hopes to help you understand how best to work with me. I care deeply about the work I do and the people on my team and I want to help you be your best self and do your best work.

## TLDR
I believe in doing the right thing. I believe in collaborative teams without bullies. I love to ship things quickly and iteratively. I love to learn and to teach. I value context. I will help you become the best person you can be if you let me. I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged. I'm an introvert. I recommend reading [Radical Candor](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/radical-candor-en/) to understand my feelings on feedback and watching [Fresh Off the Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Off_the_Boat) (seasons 1-4) to understand my motivations for running a team.

## My philosophy

I often ask people "What is your purpose in life?" I think it's a very telling question and I hope a thought-provoking one! For me, the answer has been pretty consistent for the past few years: **My purpose in life is to help people become the best they can be.**

I have always had a strong drive to help people and do the right thing. This often gets me into trouble more often than I like to admit (if it's not a HELL YES, it's a no), but I rarely regret it. I have a very strong moral compass, which can make it either easy or difficult to work with me! Doing the right thing is often hard, but it's the right thing.

[Radical Candor](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/radical-candor-en/) is perhaps the best resource to understand my approach to management and feedback. I believe in giving timely, honest feedback _because I care about you._ I don't believe in surprising people at review time with bad feedback. Your performance reviews should be underwhelming events because you should always know where you stand with me at all times. You can read more about my thoughts on feedback [here](https://medium.com/@tsunamino/setting-goals-with-your-engineers-that-dont-completely-suck-cb76b87e4275).

## My role

I like to think of myself as a momma bear coaching a soccer team that my cubs are on. I will 100% eat any other bears that dares to hurt my team, but I also expect my cubsters to be on their best behavior and to be excellent team players. Everyone must shake hands (or paws, if you must) with the other team at the end of the game. No exceptions.

![obligatory bear gif](bear.gif)

In real people terms, it means I expect my reports to be collaborative team players and to be good sports if something does go wrong. There is no room for ego on my team. **There is no room for bullies on this team.** If someone is doing really well on the team, we should all celebrate that person's work! If you're doing really well, we will also celebrate you! If you need to constantly be in the limelight **at the expense of others**, then you may want to reconsider if this is the best fit for you.

I also identify pretty strongly with Jessica from [Fresh Off the Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Off_the_Boat) (in the first 4 seasons at least). I'll push you to do your absolute best, but it's only because I care about your future!

My role as the EM on this team is to:

- trust you to do your job
- unblock you
- provide you with a safe environment to grow into a well-rounded human
- give you timely feedback, both good and constructive
- get you the resources you need
- challenge you in ways that will help you grow
- champion your accomplishments to anyone who will listen (and even those who won't)

My role is not to:

- do your job for you
- enable laziness

You do have to meet me halfway. I will be your biggest cheerleader, but I can't be everywhere at once! Sometimes I'll ask you to write down what you're doing to help me out. Sometimes it's because I legit have too many things to focus on and I need an easy way to recall all the amazing things that you've done lately. Help me help you get more money!

## What do I value most?

I value honesty over saving face.

I value genuine efforts to improve over using the "correct" words all the time.

I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged.

I value context.

I value consent and boundaries.

I value collaboration and clear communication over ego (including my own).

I value mental health over shipping velocity.

I value shipping iteratively and quickly.

I value learning from mistakes over blaming others.

I value emotional labor.

I value getting things done.

I value having fun! We do serious things, but we don't necessarily have to be serious all the time.

I understand that it can be difficult to trust a new manager. You've probably been burned before! But hopefully laying out my values can help you understand where I'm coming from. I will always tell you as much information as I know and am able to tell you. I will always care about you as a person and your wellbeing. I will always fight for what is the right thing to do. My values are the most important thing to me.

## My Expectations

**I expect you, dear reader, to give me your best effort each day.** I understand some days are just not working out. That's totes fine. I want to work with you to make sure that you have a reasonable workload with reasonable deadlines and you are taking care of yourself. If you aren't able to give it your all for whatever reason, let's talk about it sooner rather than later!

**I expect you to show up on time and be present at meetings.** I hate useless meetings and promise to keep them to a minimum. There will always be an agenda. They'll probably always be remote meetings. There will be a facilitator and a notetaker. So put on some pj pants and hop on video and be fully present for the short time we have together.

**I expect you to help out your fellow teammates if they need help.** We all have trouble here and there and no one likes to feel like a burden! If someone is asking for help then let's help teach one another the skills we need to solve the problem.

**I expect you to be respectful of one another's lived experiences.** I hate to use a buzzword, but diversity & inclusion is super important to making good teams. That means sometimes misunderstandings happen! But I expect you to be respectful of someone's lived experiences. However, keep in mind that I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of those with more privilege. Power dynamics in terms of race, gender and gender expression, sexual identity or expression, class, disability, religion, age, body size, etc will always be kept in mind. **Clarifying questions: good. Dismissing someone's lived experiences: bad.**


## Feedback

I realize that as a manager there is a power imbalance between us. I hope that you will feel comfortable speaking to me about feedback in our daily stand ups, async/sync retrospectives, 1:1s, and performance reviews. However, I recognize that it's not easy to do so! **Please feel free to speak to my manager if you have any feedback about my performance that you don't feel comfortable telling me.** You can also tell your teammates if you feel comfortable doing so, and hopefully they will pass it along to me.

## Availability

I am a strong believer in work/life balance. **I do not expect you to respond to pings (with the exception of dotcom oncall rotation) unless it is normal business hours in your time zone.** I highly discourage working on the weekend! (side projects are ok) I will not respond to pings on the weekend or during the evenings unless it's urgent. I encourage everyone to take liberal use of the Do Not Disturb feature. Remember: newer teammates may feel they need to work on weekends if they see you doing it!

## Expenses and Requests

I prefer to be asked about days off. And please ask about expenses that seem out of the ordinary (ie- expensive or not easily/recognizably related to work). (shamelessly lifted from @asheren's README)

# Meetings

I'm a strong believer in having [useful, short, productive meetings](https://blog.liberationist.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-successful-meetings-563bd2e172d3), in-person/video meetings for clarity and emotional connection, and making sure everything is well-documented. I value your time as well as my own, so **each meeting starts and ends on time**, and will be facilitated and have notes at the end. I also welcome longer one-off meetings! If there's something you need help with right now, please don't hesitate to throw something on my calendar.

## 1:1s

1:1s are our time to **work together** on _your career_. They will always have agendas, have a space to add any additional emotional labor you're doing, and be a space for us to work on the next portion of your career. They are typically 30 min every week.

You can read more about my feelings on goals and 1:1s [here](https://medium.com/@tsunamino/setting-goals-with-your-engineers-that-dont-completely-suck-cb76b87e4275)

I will use these 1:1s to give you feedback, unblock you, work on your goals, and help you with anything that you need help with. I will take notes during these meetings so we remember what we worked on, but I encourage you to take your own notes as well!

We can work together to set a meeting cadence that works for us. Both of us have the ability to reschedule our 1:1 if the time doesn't work out.

## Daily Stand Up

Our daily standup is every day for ten minutes. It's led by that week's first responder (randomly assigned via PagerDuty), and we each go over:

- Any blockers
- What we worked on since the last standup
- What we're currently working on

We currently use Geekbot to facilitate our async stand ups, as many people have indicated that it's useful for them to list things down. I keep an eye on these async standups to:

- Check if anyone is blocked for an unreasonable amount of time
- Keep a general temperature check on things if people are stressed
- Stay informed if someone is in a different time zone

Geekbot should not be:

- A place to compare your status with other team member statuses! Different people have different projects with different scope - keep focused on your definition of "productive"

All members of the team are expected to attend/participate.

## Bi-Weekly Iterations

Our bi-weekly iterations are planning and sync meetings with the team and representatives from other teams we work with.

Every two weeks, we will meet to discuss:
- Work we are planning on doing
- Unusual metrics we've seen
- Statuses from the teams we work with
- Agenda items
- Deep dive presentations on topics of interest for the group

At the beginning every iteration, engineers should pick the work that they anticipate working on in the next two weeks from the On Deck column and assign themselves a project. **It is not a requirement to finish the entire project**, but it will help the team and external dependencies understand what to expect in the coming weeks.

All members of the team are expected to attend.

## Retrospectives

At the beginning of every month, an async retrospective issue will be opened in our repo. All members of the team (and guests!) are welcome to leave comments on the issue. On the last day of the month we have a 10 minute retrospective where we go over:

- What worked
- What could have been improved
- Action items for next time

The first responder takes notes in an issue in this repo, categorizes them, and adds the retrospective label.

All members of the team are expected to attend the synchronous retrospective.

## Office Hours

Twice a month, we have open office hours on half an hour to an hour. Anyone and everyone is welcome to join us and ask questions regarding abuse vectors, product features, or just to hang out. We often invite guests from other companies to join us so we can learn from their processes.

All members of the team are expected to attend.

## Coffee Talk

Twice a month (alternating with office hours) we have informal coffee talk for half an hour. It's completely optional for team members to attend, but highly encouraged so we can relax and get to know one another!

## Slack

Slack should be used to coordinate development efforts. It is also a place to provide a bit of a virtual water cooler and connect more with each other. Also emoji. :palm_tree: :sparkling_heart: :rocket:

We have a public channel for work talk and a private channel for more sensitive topics.

## Known failures

As much as I like to think I'm a robot who will live forever without feelings, I often fail pretty hard. Some known failure modes I have are:

- overcommitting to events and burning out
- getting overwhelmed at social events (I am an introvert after all)
- forgetting to do self-care
- not liking being told what to do (asking questions has a much better success rate)

Ways I'm working on these: 
- regularly going to therapy
- regularly going to the gym 
- actively working on [closing the stress cycle](https://www.amazon.com/Burnout-Secret-Unlocking-Stress-Cycle-ebook/dp/B07DT4GW16/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1567181581&sr=8-1) 
- [photography](https://instagram.com/danielleleongphoto)
- limiting the number of extracurricular activities I do
- regularly taking time off
- limiting social media usage

Ways you can help!
- remind me to take breaks (I always appreciate this)
- remind me to delegate
- give me some space if it looks like it's That Kind of Day
- snacks. Snacks are always appreciated (savory preferred). Or coffee/tea.
- start with questions and context - I always value learning about your understanding of a situation so that we can be on the same page

## Conclusion

Thank you for slogging through my very long README. Hopefully this helps you understand how to work better with me. Please feel free to open a PR with any suggestions!
