# How does Danielle even

Welcome to my README! I realize I can be a little scary to work with, but I promise that I'm actually not here to rip your arms off. I want to help you! With that being said, I've got a few quirks that I hope I can clarify before things get weird.

## TLDR
I believe in doing the right thing. I believe in collaborative teams without bullies. I will help you become the best person you can be if you let me. I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged. I'm an introvert. I recommend reading [Radical Candor](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/radical-candor-en/) to understand my feelings on feedback.

## My philosophy

I often ask people "What is your purpose in life?" I think it's a very telling question and I hope that you will one day be able to answer what you want to do when you grow up! For me, the answer has been pretty consistant for the past few years: **My purpose in life is to help people become the best they can be.**

I have always had a strong drive to help people and do the right thing. This often gets me into trouble more often than I like to admit (if it's not a HELL YES, it's a no), but I rarely regret it. I have a very strong moral compass, which can make it either easy or difficult to work with me! Doing the right thing is often hard, but it's the right thing.

[Radical Candor](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/radical-candor-en/) is perhaps the best resource to understand my approach to management and feedback. I believe in giving timely, honest feedback _because I care about you._ I don't believe in surprising people at review time with bad feedback. Your performance reviews should be underwhelming events because you should always know where you stand with me at all times. You can read more about my thoughts on feedback [here](https://medium.com/@tsunamino/setting-goals-with-your-engineers-that-dont-completely-suck-cb76b87e4275).

## My role

I like to think of myself as a momma bear coaching a soccer team that my cubs are on. I will 100% eat any other bears that dares to hurt my team, but I also expect my cubsters to be on their best behavior and to be excellent team players. Everyone must shake hands (or paws, if you must) with the other team at the end of the game. No exceptions.

In real people terms, it means I expect my reports to be collaborative team players and to be good sports if something does go wrong. There is no room for ego on my team. **There is no room for bullies on this team.** If someone is doing really well on the team, we should all celebrate that person's work! If you're doing really well, we will also celebrate you! If you need to constantly be in the limelight **at the expense of others**, then you may want to reconsider if this is the best fit for you.

My role as the EM on this team is to:

- trust you to do your job
- unblock you
- provide you with a safe environment to grow into a well-rounded human
- give you timely feedback, both good and constructive
- get you the resources you need
- challenge you in ways that will help you grow
- champion your accomplishments to anyone who will listen (and even those who won't)

My role is not to:

- do your job for you
- enable laziness

You do have to meet me halfway. I will be your biggest cheerleader, but I can't be everywhere at once! Sometimes I'll ask you to write down what you're doing to help me out. Sometimes it's because I legit have too many things to focus on and I need an easy way to recall all the amazing things that you've done lately. Help me help you get more money!

## What do I value most?

I value honesty over saving face.

I value genuine efforts to improve over using the "correct" words all the time.

**I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged.**

I value context.

I value consent and boundaries.

I value collaboration and clear communication over ego (including my own).

I value mental health over shipping velocity.

I value learning from mistakes over blaming others.

I value emotional labor.

I value getting things done.

I understand that it can be difficult to trust a new manager. You've probably been burned before! But hopefully laying out my values can help you understand where I'm coming from. I will always tell you as much information as I know and am able to tell you. I will always care about you as a person and your wellbeing. I will always fight for what is the right thing to do. My values are the most important thing to me.

## My Expectations

**I expect you, dear reader, to give me your best effort each day.** I understand some days are just not working out. That's totes fine. I want to work with you to make sure that you have a reasonable workload with reasonable deadlines and you are taking care of yourself. If you aren't able to give it your all for whatever reason, let's talk about it sooner rather than later!

**I expect you to show up on time and be present at meetings.** I hate useless meetings and promise to keep them to a minimum. There will always be an agenda. They'll probably always be remote meetings. So put on some pj pants and hop on video and be fully present for the short time we have together.

**I expect you to help out your fellow teammates if they need help.** We all have trouble here and there and no one likes to feel like a burden! If someone is asking for help then let's help teach one another the skills we need to solve the problem.

**I expect you to be respectful of one another's lived experiences.** I hate to use a buzzword, but diversity & inclusion is super important to making good teams. That means sometimes misunderstandings happen! But I expect you to be respectful of someone's lived experiences. However, keep in mind that I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of those with more privilege. Power dynamics in terms of race, gender and gender expression, sexual identity or expression, class, disability, religion, age, body size, etc will always be kept in mind. Clarifying questions: good. Dismissing someone's lived experiences: bad.


## Feedback

I realize that as a manager there is a power imbalance between us. I hope that you will feel comfortable speaking to me about feedback in our daily stand ups, async retrospectives, 1:1s, and performance reviews. However, I recognize that it's not easy to do so! **Please feel free to speak to my manager if you have any feedback about my performance that you don't feel comfortable telling me.** You can also tell your teammates if you feel comfortable doing so, and hopefully they will pass it along to me.

## Availability

I am a strong believer in work/life balance. **I do not expect you to respond to pings (with the exception of dotcom oncall rotation) unless it is normal business hours in your time zone.** I highly discourage working on the weekend! (side projects are ok) I will not respond to pings on the weekend or during the evenings unless it's urgent. I encourage everyone to take liberal use of the Do Not Disturb feature. Remember: newer teammates may feel they need to work on weekends if they see you doing it!

## 1:1s

1:1s are our time to **work together** on _your career_. They will always have agendas, have a space to add any additional emotional labor you're doing, and be a space for us to work on the next portion of your career. They are typically 30 min every week.

You can read more about my feelings on goals and 1:1s [here](https://medium.com/@tsunamino/setting-goals-with-your-engineers-that-dont-completely-suck-cb76b87e4275)

I will use these 1:1s to give you feedback, unblock you, work on your goals, and help you with anything that you need help with. I will take notes during these meetings so we remember what we worked on, but I encourage you to take your own notes as well!

## Known failures

As much as I like to think I'm a robot who will live forever without feelings, I often fail pretty hard. Some known failure modes I have are:

- overcommitting to events and burning out
- getting overwhelmed at social events (I am an introvert after all)
- forgetting to do self-care
- not liking being told what to do (asking questions has a much better success rate)

Ways you can help!
- remind me to take breaks (I always appreciate this)
- remind me to delegate
- give me some space if it looks like it's That Kind of Day
- snacks. Snacks are always appreciated (savory preferred). Or coffee/tea.

## Conclusion

Thank you for slogging through my very long README. Hopefully this helps you understand how to work better with me. Please feel free to open a PR with any suggestions!
