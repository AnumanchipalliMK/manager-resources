## My Expectations

**I expect you, dear reader, to give me your best effort each day.** I understand some days are just not working out. That's totes fine. I want to work with you to make sure that you have a reasonable workload with reasonable deadlines and you are taking care of yourself. If you aren't able to give it your all for whatever reason, let's talk about it sooner rather than later!

**I expect you to show up on time and be present at meetings.** I hate useless meetings and promise to keep them to a minimum. There will always be an agenda. They'll probably always be remote meetings. There will be a facilitator and a notetaker. So put on some pj pants and hop on video and be fully present for the short time we have together.

**I expect you to help out your fellow teammates if they need help.** We all have trouble here and there and no one likes to feel like a burden! If someone is asking for help then let's help teach one another the skills we need to solve the problem.

**I expect you to be respectful of one another's lived experiences.** I hate to use a buzzword, but diversity & inclusion is super important to making good teams. That means sometimes misunderstandings happen! But I expect you to be respectful of someone's lived experiences. However, keep in mind that I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of those with more privilege. Power dynamics in terms of race, gender and gender expression, sexual identity or expression, class, disability, religion, age, body size, etc will always be kept in mind. **Clarifying questions: good. Dismissing someone's lived experiences: bad.**
