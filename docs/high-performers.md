## High performers

While most of the people on my teams end up being high performers, I think it's valuable to document what I've found useful.

As a high performer myself, I find that the best way to stifle someone's passion and creativity is to force them do things without a valid reason, not believe them when they raise a concern, and not pay attention to burnout levels. My general guidelines are:

- I expect high performers to motivate themselves! If you aren't motivated, then something's wrong and let's work on it together. Sometimes it's a structural problem, sometimes it's a personal problem. Whatever it is, let's talk it through and work on a solution together.

- I will do my best to guide you to new challenges. Sometimes that involves challenging you to improve your interpersonal skills with other people! These are just as valuable as technical skills.

- I will try very hard not to spring any last minute or unreasonable requests on you. It's pretty rude to constantly have to fight fires and it's bad for people's mental health to do so.

- I'll try to request things rather than tell you to do them. On the rare occasion I _require_ you to do something, I'll do my best to explain why it's important, the timeline it's needed, and who the request is coming from.

- I try acknowledge the good as well as the Needs Improvement(tm)! Sometimes as a high performer, you don't realize just how great you're doing because it's easy to move on to the next thing that needs fixing. I'll be sure to point out when you're also kicking ass.

- I'll probably keep a close on your PTO. As a high performer myself, I'm often working on a million things at once until all of a sudden I'm too exhausted to do anything. I'll likely keep a reoccurring task on our 1:1 agendas to check in on the last time you took some time off.
