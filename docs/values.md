## What do I value most?

I value honesty over saving face.

I value genuine efforts to improve over using the "correct" words all the time.

I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged.

I value context.

I value consent and boundaries.

I value collaboration and clear communication over ego (including my own).

I value mental health over shipping velocity.

I value shipping iteratively and quickly.

I value learning from mistakes over blaming others.

I value emotional labor.

I value getting things done.

I value having fun! We do serious things, but we don't necessarily have to be serious all the time.

I understand that it can be difficult to trust a new manager. You've probably been burned before! But hopefully laying out my values can help you understand where I'm coming from. I will always tell you as much information as I know and am able to tell you. I will always care about you as a person and your wellbeing. I will always fight for what is the right thing to do. My values are the most important thing to me.
